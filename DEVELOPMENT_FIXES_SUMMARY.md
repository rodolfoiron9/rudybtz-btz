# Development Server Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. Turbopack Worker Analysis Error
**Problem**: Turbopack couldn't statically analyze Web Worker creation in image optimization component
**Solution**: 
- Switched from `next dev --turbopack` to standard `next dev`
- Modified worker initialization with proper error handling
- Performance optimization components maintained

### 2. Duplicate Route Conflicts  
**Problem**: Conflicting robots.txt and sitemap.xml routes causing warnings
**Solution**:
- Removed legacy route files: `src/app/robots.txt/route.ts` and `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`
- Kept modern Next.js 15 files: `src/app/robots.ts` and `src/app/sitemap.ts`

### 3. Cross-Origin Request Warning
**Problem**: Network IP requests flagged for future compatibility
**Solution**:
- Added `allowedDevOrigins: ['192.168.1.166:3000']` to `next.config.ts`
- Ensures future Next.js version compatibility
