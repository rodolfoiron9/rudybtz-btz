## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Ultra Violet (#7F00FF) for interactive elements and highlights, embodying a futuristic and vibrant aesthetic.
- Background color: Graffiti Gray (#99A3A4) for a textured, modern feel.
- Accent color: Neon Cyan (#00FFFF) to complement the ultra violet, used sparingly to draw attention to key UI elements, placed ~30 degrees away from the ultra violet on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Orbitron' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text. Use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text where longer paragraphs are used. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Custom SVG icons to match the neon aesthetic and maintain consistency.
- Glassmorphism: Apply frosted glass effects to modals, cards, and panels, using semi-transparent backgrounds with blur.
- Glow Effect: Implement subtle neon glow effects on interactive elements on hover and focus.
